# Project Todo Today 
Finally, what you've all been waiting for - an uplifting todo app!
The goal was to build a todo app where the user can add a todo, check/mark it done,
and delete it.

## The problem
First, the app was outlined in Figma. One of the most prominent design-feature is the FAB-button that 
hides and shows the input bar. It was important that there was some sense of deadline and 
priority buttons to easy highlight how important the task was. 

Next, the project was built in VScode using JavaScript & React. 
Other technologies used: 
* Npm packages
UniqId  -  https://www.npmjs.com/package/uniqid (for creating unique IDs to the tasks)
Styled Components - https://styled-components.com (Styling and CSS)
Moment - https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment (Dates, times)
